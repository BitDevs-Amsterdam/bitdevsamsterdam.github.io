## BitDevs Amsterdam meeting 009!

It's time for our first BitDevs of 2024! A big thanks to [Bitonic](https://bitonic.nl/) for sponsoring us with the meeting space and snacks! Drinks and light snacks will be provided, so please ensure you have some dinner beforehand or bring it along to the seminar.

### Thursday, February 15th 2024 @ 7PM

Doors open at 6:30PM and we will try to start promptly at 7PM. As a reminder, the ground rules of BitDevs are as follows:

1. No photos, videos, or recordings.
1. [Chatham House Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule): you may
   reiterate the contents of the meeting *without* attribution.

These rules exist so that BitDevs participants can speak freely within the event.

# Agenda

The agenda will be finalized the week before the event. You can follow along with the work in progress agenda on our [github repository](https://github.com/bitdevsamsterdam/bitdevsamsterdam.github.io/issues/17). Feel free to suggest topics you'd like to discuss on the github issue!
