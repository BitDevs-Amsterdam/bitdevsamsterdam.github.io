## Welcome to BitDevs Amsterdam meeting 001!

After a long hiatus, BitDevs Amsterdam lives again! Join us for pizza and drinks and to talk about everyone's favorite subject: Bitcoin!

### Wednesday, November 30 2022 @ 7PM

As a reminder, the ground rules of BitDevs are as follow:

1. No photos, videos, or recordings.
1. [Chatham House Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule): you may
   reiterate the contents of the meeting *without* attribution.

These rules exist so that BitDevs participants can speak freely
within the event.

# Agenda

We will post the agenda a few days before the event, so be sure to check back!
