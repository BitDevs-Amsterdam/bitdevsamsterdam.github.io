It's time for our last BitDevs of 2023! A big thanks to [Bitonic](https://bitonic.nl/) for sponsoring us with the meeting space and snacks! Drinks and light snacks will be provided, so please ensure you have some dinner beforehand or bring it along to the seminar.

### Thursday, December 14th 2023 @ 7PM

Doors open at 6:30PM and we will try to start promptly at 7PM. As a reminder, the ground rules of BitDevs are as follows:

1. No photos, videos, or recordings.
1. [Chatham House Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule): you may
