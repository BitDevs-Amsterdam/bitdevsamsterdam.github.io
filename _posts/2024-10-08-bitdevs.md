## BitDevs Amsterdam meeting 013, the pre Bitcoin Amsterdam version!

It's time for another BitDevs! A big thanks to [Bitonic](https://bitonic.nl/) for sponsoring us with the meeting space and snacks! Drinks and light snacks will be provided, so please ensure you have some dinner beforehand or bring it along to the seminar.

### Tuesday, October 8th 2024 @ 7PM

Doors open at 6:30PM and we will try to start promptly at 7PM. As a reminder, the ground rules of BitDevs are as follows:

1. No photos, videos, or recordings.
1. [Chatham House Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule): you may
