## BitDevs Amsterdam meeting 007!

It's time for a special edition of BitDevs, _The BitDevs Conference Edition!_ We hope to have a lot of friends from out of town joining, so we'll be meeting at a different place and different time than usual! Please read the details below carefully!

### Wednesday, October 11th 2023 @ 3PM

We will be meeting at the [MACA Amsterdam](https://www.maca.amsterdam/) in Amsterdam Noord:

* Address: Ms. van Riemsdijkweg 61, 1033 RC Amsterdam

<br />
Doors open at 2:00PM and we will try to start promptly at 3PM. Light snacks will be provided. We will join our friends for [De Bitcoin Meetup at Blast Galaxy](https://www.meetup.com/de-bitcoin-meetup/events/294584411/) for food and drinks (~10 min walk away, starting at 5PM).

Please RSVP (either through our meetup page or to *bitdevsamsterdam at protonmail dot com*) as we are expecting a larger crowd than usual and space at our venue is limited to 100 people. We hope to see you at both the BitDevs and the Blast Galaxy Bitcoin Meetup for good discussion, good food, and good drinks with great people! Let's kick off the conference with a bang!

As a reminder, the BitDevs rules are:
